# Claude-3.7-sonnet Weather Card Experience

## first prompt:
```
Create a single HTML file containing CSS and JavaScript to generate an animated weather card. The card should visually represent the following weather conditions with distinct animations: Wind: (e.g., moving clouds, swaying trees, or wind lines) Rain: (e.g., falling raindrops, puddles forming) Sun: (e.g., shining rays, bright background) Snow: (e.g., falling snowflakes, snow accumulating) Show all the weather card side by side The card should have a dark background. Provide all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code within this single file. The JavaScript should include a way to switch between the different weather conditions (e.g., a function or a set of buttons) to demonstrate the animations for each.
